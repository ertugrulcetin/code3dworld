# Contributing Guide #

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Code 3D World. This is a
generic guide that details how to contribute to Code 3D World in a way that
is efficient for everyone.


## Reporting Bugs ##

We are using [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/ertugrulcetin/code3dworld/issues)
for our public bugs. We keep a close eye on this and try to make it
clear when we have an internal fix in progress. Before filing a new
task, try to make sure your problem doesn't already exist.

If you found a bug, please report it, as far as possible with:

- A detailed explanation of steps to reproduce the error
- A dev tools console exception stack trace (if it is available)

## Pull requests ##

If you want to propose a change or bug fix with the Pull-Request system
firstly you should carefully format your commits accordingly.

If you intend to fix a bug it's fine to submit a pull request right
away but we still recommend to file an issue detailing what you're
fixing. This is helpful in case we don't accept that specific fix but
want to keep track of the issue.

If you want to implement or start working in a new feature, please
open a **question** / **discussion** issue for it. No pull-request
will be accepted without previous chat about the changes,
independently if it is a new feature, already planned feature or small
quick win.

If is going to be your first pull request, You can learn how from this
free video series:
